I like programming in Rust, but documentation is important too. It is nice if you use Free (Libre) Software, although I also do not exclusively use Free Software.

I'm currently working on the fediverse server [Misskey](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey) and associated projects. The software is already awesome and I recommend everyone to give it a go, either as user or instance administrator.
The main developer is not very well funded at the moment, so it would be appreciated if you could help them out on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/syuilo).

Some of my projects are also available outside of GitHub at <https://git.qwertqwefsday.eu>.

You can view my public GPG keys in this repository too:
