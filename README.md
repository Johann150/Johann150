I like programming in Rust, but documentation is important too. It is nice if you use Free (Libre) Software, although I also do not exclusively use Free Software.

I'm currently working on the simple Gemini protocol server [agate](https://github.com/mbrubeck/agate).
I'm also developing my own programming language called [ypss](https://github.com/Johann150/ypss).

Some of my projects are also available outside of GitHub at <https://git.qwertqwefsday.eu>.

You can view my public GPG keys in this repository too:
